      "Summary\n",
      "After a slow start, the comparative analysis of clockgenes in insects has developed into a mature area ofstudy in recent years. Brain transplant or surgicalinterventions in larger insects deﬁned much of theearly work in this area, before the cloning of clockgenes became possible. We discuss the evolution ofclock genes, their key sequence differences, and theirlikely modes of regulation in several different insectorders. We also present their expression patterns inthe brain, focusing particularly on Diptera, Lepidoptera,and Orthoptera, the most common non-genetic modelinsects studied. We also highlight the adaptive involve-ment of clock molecules in other complex phenotypeswhich require biological timing, such as social behaviour,diapause and migration.\n",

      "Introduction \n",
      "Circadian rhythms are important regulatory processes,which, almost universally, are used to harmonise physiologyand behaviour with the 24 h geophysical cycles of light andtemperature of our planet. The clock therefore is at theinterface between the organism and the external environmentand, as for other signalling pathways, it probes the outsideworld, transducing external changes to downstreameffectors. In the last 25 years or so, the phenomenologywhich contributed to most of the circadian literature beforeabout 1984, was replaced by the more pragmatic moleculargenetic analysis of the clock, initially in  Drosophila  \n",
      "(Hall,2003). At the cellular level, molecules which exemplify theprogression of time are cyclically transformed. Phosphoryla-tion, degradation and altered subcellular localisation ofclock proteins, result in modiﬁed expression of clock andclock controlled genes, ultimately coordinating the activitiesof the organism with its environment (aka ‘entrainment’)(Hall, 2003; Zheng & Sehgal, 2008). The same chain ofevents persists, with minor differences, also under constant‘free-running’ conditions, suggesting that the internal milieufunctions as a self-sustaining oscillation that continues inthe absence of any periodic input. Such a design is acommon feature of all circadian clocks (Dunlap, 1999) andit underlines the mechanistic constraints encountered(more than once) in the evolution of circadian systems.\n",

This ev olution-ary plasticity is observed between insect species and evenwithin-species (Costa & Kyriacou, 1998; Helfrich-Forster,2005c; Yuan  et al ., 2007; Kyriacou  et al ., 2008).
